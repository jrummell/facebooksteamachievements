# Steam Achievements for Facebook

Steam Achievements is a Facebook app that displays and publishes achievements for Steam games. It's an IFrame Canvas application built with ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Identity, [Facebook .NET SDK](http://facebooksdk.codeplex.com/), and jQuery. You can see it action at https://fbsteamachievements.azurewebsites.net/

## How it works
Achievements are parsed from your Steam community profile in XML format:

    http://steamcommunity.com/id/[steamid]/stats/[game]/?xml=1

For example, my Left 4 Dead stats page is http://steamcommunity.com/id/NullReference/stats/L4D/?xml=1.
