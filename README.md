# FacebookSteamAchievements

Steam Achievements is a Facebook app that displays and publishes achievements for Steam games. It's an IFrame Canvas application built with ASP.NET, [Facebook .NET SDK](http://facebooksdk.codeplex.com/), and jQuery. You can see it action at https://apps.facebook.com/steamachievementsx/

## How it works
Achievements are parsed from your Steam community profile in XML format:

    http://steamcommunity.com/id/[steamid]/stats/[game]/?xml=1

For example, my Left 4 Dead stats page is http://steamcommunity.com/id/NullReference/stats/L4D/?xml=1.
